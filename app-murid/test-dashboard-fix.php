echo "1. Start the app-murid server:\n";
echo "   cd c:\\xampp\\htdocs\\simaklah-main\\app-murid\n";
echo "   php spark serve --port=8080\n\n";

echo "2. Open browser and go to: http://localhost:8080\n\n";

echo "3. Login with any of the test credentials above\n\n";

echo "4. Check that the dashboard loads without the 'nisn' error\n\n";

echo "5. Verify that:\n";
echo "   - User name displays correctly\n";
echo "   - ID shows instead of NISN (since users table doesn't have nisn)\n";
echo "   - Email shows correctly or 'Tidak tersedia' if empty\n";
echo "   - Username displays correctly\n";
echo "   - No PHP errors in browser or console\n\n";

echo "=== EXPECTED BEHAVIOR ===\n";
echo "- Dashboard should load without errors\n";
echo "- User info should display with ID instead of NISN\n";
echo "- All Safe Space features should work normally\n";
echo "- Redirects should maintain port consistency\n\n";

echo "=== WHAT WAS FIXED ===\n";
echo "- Added isset() check for 'nisn' field in dashboard view\n";
echo "- Falls back to showing user ID if 'nisn' doesn't exist\n";
echo "- Added safe check for email field too\n";
echo "- This prevents 'Undefined array key' errors\n\n";

echo "Test completed. Ready for manual verification!\n";
