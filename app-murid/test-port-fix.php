/**
 * Test Port Consistency Fix
 */

echo "=== TESTING PORT CONSISTENCY FIX ===\n";

echo "\n=== CHANGES MADE ===\n";
echo "✅ Created app/Helpers/redirect_helper.php\n";
echo "✅ Updated app/Config/Autoload.php to load helper\n";
echo "✅ Updated Auth.php to use redirect_with_port()\n";
echo "✅ Updated SafeSpaceController.php to use redirect_with_port()\n";
echo "✅ Added dynamic baseURL to App.php\n";

echo "\n=== HOW IT WORKS ===\n";
echo "1. redirect_with_port() detects current host and port\n";
echo "2. Maintains the same port in redirects\n";
echo "3. Works with any port (8080, 9000, 3000, etc.)\n";
echo "4. Dynamic baseURL in App.php adapts to request\n";

echo "\n=== TESTING STEPS ===\n";
echo "1. Test with default port:\n";
echo "   php spark serve --port=8080\n";
echo "   Visit: http://localhost:8080/login\n";
echo "   Login and verify dashboard stays on port 8080\n";
echo "\n";

echo "2. Test with different port:\n";
echo "   php spark serve --port=9000\n";
echo "   Visit: http://localhost:9000/login\n";
echo "   Login and verify dashboard stays on port 9000\n";
echo "\n";

echo "3. Test with another port:\n";
echo "   php spark serve --port=3000\n";
echo "   Visit: http://localhost:3000/login\n";
echo "   Login and verify dashboard stays on port 3000\n";
echo "\n";

echo "=== TEST CREDENTIALS ===\n";
echo "Username: siswa_001\n";
echo "Password: siswa123\n";

echo "\n=== WHAT TO VERIFY ===\n";
echo "✅ Login page loads on correct port\n";
echo "✅ After login, URL stays on same port\n";
echo "✅ Dashboard links maintain port\n";
echo "✅ Safe Space pages maintain port\n";
echo "✅ Logout redirects to same port\n";

echo "\n=== BEFORE vs AFTER ===\n";
echo "BEFORE:\n";
echo "- Start on port 9000\n";
echo "- Login redirects to port 8080\n";
echo "- Port inconsistency\n";
echo "\n";
echo "AFTER:\n";
echo "- Start on port 9000\n";
echo "- Login stays on port 9000\n";
echo "- All pages maintain port 9000\n";

echo "\n=== FILES TO CHECK ===\n";
echo "1. app/Helpers/redirect_helper.php - New helper functions\n";
echo "2. app/Config/Autoload.php - Helper autoloading\n";
echo "3. app/Config/App.php - Dynamic baseURL\n";
echo "4. app/Controllers/Auth.php - Uses redirect_with_port()\n";
echo "5. app/Controllers/SafeSpaceController.php - Uses redirect_with_port()\n";

echo "\n=== READY FOR TESTING! ===\n";
echo "Run: php spark serve --port=9000\n";
echo "Test: http://localhost:9000/login\n";
